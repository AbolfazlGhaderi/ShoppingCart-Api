# ShoppingCart-Api
Creating a new order (shopping cart) and saving orders in the database through API - | React , NodeJs And Mysql |

I developed this project to practice `api` connections.
 The client part of this project is for  [Mr.Masood Sadri](https://youtu.be/kgw0ix0AUBA?si=3-fd2Z18fuQxhnkI) , but I made various small changes in the client part.

 I am a BackEnd developer, that's why I might have mistakes in the client side ! ❤️
